# Site info

This site is an experiment in merging a traditional developer portfolio with a digital garden structure. I intend on updating the pages here frequently, so [[everything]] is subject to change.

This website was made using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and the source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/mwassen/mswsn.com). I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a makeshift CMS to spit out markdown files that are then read by Gatsby's site generator.

The design of the site is partly inspired by [Liam Cooke's](https://liamcooke.com/) website and a number of other sites found on this [Webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/). The typeface used on the site is [Manrope](https://manropefont.com/).
